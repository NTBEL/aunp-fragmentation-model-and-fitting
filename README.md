# aunp-fragmentation-model-and-fitting

The fitting and model analysis are part of our __J. Phys. Chem. C__ paper: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c06684

The distribution fitting was used to generate the solid fit lines and mean AuNP size estimates in Figure 2A.

The fragmentation model was used to generate the Model results in Figure 4E.

All of the analysis is contained associated [notebooks](./notebooks) (Jupyter IPython notebooks).
